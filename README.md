# Random Password Generator

This is a simple web application that generates a random password based on user criteria. The generated password can include a specified number of characters (between 8 and 128), and can include a combination of special characters, upper case letters, lower case letters, and numbers.

## How to Use
Click the "Generate Password" button to start the process.
Enter the desired number of characters for the password when prompted.
Choose whether or not to include special characters, upper case letters, lower case letters, and numbers by answering "Yes" or "No" to each prompt.

If you choose not to include any types of characters, you will be prompted to select at least one type of character.

Once all prompts are completed, the generated password will be displayed in the "Your Password" field.

## How it Works
The application works by first prompting the user to enter the desired number of characters for the password. The input is then validated to ensure that it falls within the range of 8 to 128 characters.

Next, the application prompts the user to choose which types of characters to include in the password. 

If the user does not select at least one type of character, they will be prompted to select at least one type before continuing.

Once the user has selected their desired criteria, the application generates a random password based on the chosen parameters. 

The password is displayed in the "Your Password" field for the user to copy and use as desired.
